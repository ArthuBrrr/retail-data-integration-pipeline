Market Interpretation

1 - Is the real estate market increasing, decreasing, or stable?

Based on the analysis of the latest available data (June 2025), the French real estate market appears to be increasing.
Compared to the same month of the previous year (June 2024), median prices have risen:

Apartments: from 3,291 €/m² to 3,661 €/m² (+370 €/m²)
Houses: from 2,108 €/m² to 2,313 €/m² (+205 €/m², approximately +9.7%)
This simultaneous increase in both apartment and house prices indicates a clear upward trend in the national real estate market.

2 - Are the most expensive departments also the most active?

The results show that the most expensive departments are not necessarily the most active.
Paris (75) is both the most expensive department (≈ 10,485 €/m²) and one of the most active in terms of transactions, which makes it an exception.
However, other highly active departments such as Nord (59), Bouches-du-Rhône (13), or Gironde (33) have significantly lower median prices.
Conversely, some very expensive departments (e.g. Hauts-de-Seine, Val-de-Marne) do not appear at the top of the transaction volume ranking.
This indicates that high prices do not systematically imply high transaction volumes.

3 - What regional disparities can you observe?

Strong regional disparities are clearly visible:
Île-de-France stands out with the highest prices, especially Paris and its surrounding departments.
Southern departments (Alpes-Maritimes, Var, Corse-du-Sud) combine relatively high prices with moderate to high activity, reflecting strong attractiveness.
Large and populous departments (Nord, Rhône, Loire-Atlantique) show very high transaction volumes but more moderate prices.
Rural or less densely populated areas are much less represented in the top rankings, highlighting uneven market dynamics across regions.
Overall, the French real estate market is characterized by significant geographic inequalities, driven by population density, economic attractiveness, and urbanization.
